# Pandemic Georgia

By Zach Barbre, Lockett Pundt, Micheal Bamba, Joshua Bevers

## Purpose

This is a version of the boardgame Pandemic. It was created during the backend project for DigitalCrafts.

## Technologies

Pandemic Georgia was built using Node.js, Express, Express-es6-template-engine, Bulma and a PostgreSQL database hosted at ElephantSQL. It is currently deployed on AWS at pandemic-georgia.zachbarbre.com.

## Clone

If you would like to clone and run the game you must run npm run css-build after running npm install and prior to npm start. This builds the Bulma stylesheet.
